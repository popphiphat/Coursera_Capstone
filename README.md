# Coursera_Capstone : The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1)

### 1. Introduction 

Bangkok is the capital and most populous city of  Thailand. Over 8 million people lived within Bangkok and this city is the most visited city in the world with approximately 23 million tourists per year
The shopping malls are one of the places that Thai people and tourists usually visit and spend a lot of money. Therefore, if we are able to help decision making on finding the best location to build a shopping mall. It can reduce the risk for investors and also able to attract more tourists to visit and spend. Businesses can make more informed decisions that can improve both efficiency and effectiveness.

In this project, I will try to understand the preferneces of each district by leveraging venue data from Foursquare’s ‘Places API’ and ‘k-means clustering’ machine learning algorithm.

### 2. Data sources

Based on definition of our problem the following sources will be needed for the analysis :

1. List of districts in Bangkok. This defines the scope of this project which is confined to the city of Bangkok from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_of_Bangkok, In this data , we can see district code, district name, population, latitude and longitude 

2. Th list of Latitude and longitude coordinates of these districts is required in order to plot the map and also to get the nearby venue data from Foursquare

3. Venue data from Foursquare API, particularly data related to shopping malls. I will use this data to perform clustering on the districts.
